<h1>NeXtPC ecommerce app</h1>

<p>Hello! I would like to present with the greatest pleasure my most advanced project, which is a fully functional ecommerce website selling electronic items. I created the entire project from scratch: the frontend was written in NextJS (also Typescript), the backend in NodeJS using ExpressJS and Mongoose, and I used a MongoDB database (REST API). The page is fully responsive - for mobiles, tablets and desktops. The application contains many pages - starting with the home page through individual product categories, sub-pages with individual products, where you can rate the products, the ability to log in/register, and the entire process of buying a product up to payment (which, of course, since this is not a full-fledged application, ends when you have to pay for the product). Being logged in allows you to add products to your favorites, save your data and track products later.</p>

<p>I encourage you to check the website - uploaded to vercel <a href='https://nextpc.vercel.app/'>NeXtPC ecommerce app</a></p>

<h2>Important Notice!</h2>
<p>Please note that the backend is hosted on a free server (render.com), which may take up to 30 seconds to start. As a result, photos and data might take a moment to load. I apologize for the inconvenienceâ€”this issue is solely due to the limitations of free hosting. In a production environment, this delay would not occur.</p>
